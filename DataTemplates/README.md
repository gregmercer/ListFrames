# ButtonsBoxes
Xamarin Forms Rooms List Performance Test Buttons vs Frames


ButtonsBoxes Data Templates
=============================
Shows the scrolling performance difference on Droid from using Buttons vs Frames in a ListView. Buttons and Frames are created within two different cs-based Data Templates. 

A listview with several of Buttons scroll much slower on Android than do Frames.

Also this sample code offers a reference for one possible way to chain together View Models, trigger bound property UI updates, and send Commands up to the top-level View Model.
